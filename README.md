This is a barbershop system made by my own.

It's a RESTful API build with Java + Spring Boot + Postgres + ReactJs that helps barbers to organize theyselfs on the daily routine.

The main purpose of this API is to turn schedulings and registers easily and faster, optimizing the time administration and allowing barbers focusing on his work properly.
